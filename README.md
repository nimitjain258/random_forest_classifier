## About Dataset
### Context

This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore related human resource questions we need to analyze employee information. Typically job class specs have information which characterize the job class- its features, and a label- in this case a pay grade - something to predict that the features are related to.

### Inspiration

The intent is to use machine learning classification algorithms to predict the attrition variable from the educational level to financial budget information.

### Task
Typically attrition detection in HR is time consuming and cumbersome as a manual activity. The intent is to show how machine learning and People Analytics can be brought to bear on this task.

To this aim, read the dataset, locate the target variable, explore your dataset, filter out unnecessary columns, preprocess the remaining columns, create a classifier, and evaluate its results.
